            <h2 id="tribute-info">Breif Introduction of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbarika"id="tribute-link" target="_blank">Barbarika</a></h2>
            <p>Barbarika, also known as Belarsen, was a grandson of Bhima (the second of the Pandava brothers) and the son of Ghatotkacha. His mother, Kamkantkata Ma Morwi, taught him the art of warfare, and he grew up to be a brave warrior. The gods bestowed upon him three infallible arrows, earning him the title “Bearer of Three Arrows” 1.</p>
    
    <p>When Barbarika learned that the battle between the Pandavas and the Kauravas was inevitable, he decided to witness the Mahābhārata War. He made a promise to his mother: if he felt the urge to participate, he would join the side that was losing. Riding his blue horse and armed with his three arrows and bow, Barbarika arrived on the battlefield 1.</p>
    
    <p>Before the Kurukshetra War began, Krishna posed a question to all the warriors: How long would it take each of them to finish the war alone? Bhishma estimated 20 days, Dronacharya said 25 days, Karna claimed 24 days, and Arjuna believed he needed 28 days 1. However, when Krishna, disguised as a Brahmin, encountered Barbarika, he asked the same question. Barbarika confidently replied that he could finish the entire war in just one minute. Intrigued, Krishna questioned how he could achieve this feat with only three arrows.</p>
    
    <p>Barbarika explained his unique strategy: The first arrow would mark all the things he wanted to destroy, the second arrow would mark what he wanted to save, and the third arrow would destroy everything marked. In other words, with one arrow, he could set targets, and with the other, he could eliminate them. Krishna then challenged him to tie all the leaves of a peepal tree using his arrows. As Barbarika meditated to release his arrow, Krishna secretly plucked a leaf and placed it under his foot. When Barbarika released his first arrow, it marked all the leaves, including the one under Krishna’s foot 1.</p>
    
    <p>Before decapitating himself, Barbarika expressed his desire to witness the battle. Krishna granted his wish by placing his head on a hill overlooking the battlefield, allowing Barbarika to watch the entire war unfold
